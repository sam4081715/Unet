## Introduction
U<sup>2</sup>-Net is a salient object detection AI method designed for image segmentation. It provides a segmentation method to extract the target from an image. In this code, we demonstrate how U^2-Net segments the target from an image using a small training set.

## Training
In this experiment, we aim to use a small training set to segment images of people. A total of 18 images are used to train the model.

## Output
